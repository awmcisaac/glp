# LEARNING TO PREDICT VISUAL ATTRIBUTES THROUGH HUMAN DISAGREEMENT
Project for Grounded Language Processing Course at University of Trento

Attribute prediction has made exciting recent progress with the emergence of attribute-centred datasets. However, the reliability of their ground truth labels does not reflect human disagreement. 
We present a comparative study of the use of soft and hard labels for this supervised multi-label classification problem. Specifically, we compared our baseline with two models that differently incorporate disagreement as information: class-level soft labels from human disagreement and self-knowledge distillation.
